# VampireSurvivorsCharacterGenerator
My Vampire Survivors Character Generator's first release!

**[DOWNLOAD THE LATEST RELEASE HERE](https://github.com/klodmood/VampireSurvivorsCharacterGenerator/releases/download/release/VampireSurvivorsCharacterGenerator_v0.1.zip)**

**Features:**


Create a random character by simply loading the application and hitting "Generate"

Create a custom character by checking the "custom character" checkbox, and entering the attributes you would like.

Function to restore unedited files when you want to return the "Red Death" character to normal.

I made this very quickly for personal use - so please backup any save data before running. I can give no guarantees and accept no liability that this software will work as intended on your machine.


**Prerequisites:**


.NET Framework 4.7.2

Vampire Survivors Installed on Steam


**How to use:**


Run the EXE

Choose either random or custom character checkbox

If custom - choose the attributes you want to configure

Press "Generate!"

If the code detects your install through Steam - it will automatically run the game. Your new character will be available in the character select screen (this replaces "Red Death")

If you wish to generate a new character - close the game, set your attributes if custom, and hit "Generate!" again

If you wish to restore your game to it's unmodified state - press "Restore Original Game Data"
